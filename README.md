# Wine Quality Analysis with Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project focuses on wine quality analysis using a dataset from Kaggle. Various machine learning and deep learning models, including Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Networks, are employed to predict the quality of wines. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and how to replicate the analysis.

## Overview

- **Dataset:** The project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains information about various attributes of different wines, such as acidity, pH, and alcohol content, along with a quality rating.

- **Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to predict the quality of wines based on these attributes using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models are implemented for the wine quality prediction task:

- **Linear Regression:** A simple regression model used as a baseline.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble model for improved prediction accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** A supervised learning model for classification and regression.

## Deep Learning Models

In addition to traditional machine learning models, deep learning models are employed:

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):** Deep neural networks are used to model complex relationships in the data for improved prediction.

## Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy.
